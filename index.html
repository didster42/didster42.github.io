                        Tunnel was the second game I published on the playstore. You control a small player (triangle) 
                        and try to evade a series of obstacles which come at you from ahead (similar to life?). I wanted to go 
                        for something trippy with a nice beat. It was because of those factors that playtesting was an incredibly fun experience. 
                        I thought it would be amazing to let other people try and beat my score, so far none have. Why don't you give it a try?

                        Square Ninja was the first game project I was able to complete. 
                        You take control of a square and attempt to survive the onslaught of an 
                        army of triangles. Its funny how lack of graphics 
                        can form the premise for your game. If you enjoy dashing through enemies 
                         with cool slow motion effects this is the game for you. 
                         You could even try beating the high score on the leaderboard, 
                         even I'm second at the moment!

                        Bachat helps you keep track of your UPI payments, <span class="boldDiff">automatically</span>. 
                        With UPI apps, paying money has become easier than ever before, because
                        we don't have the physical sensation of cash. Bachat tracks your UPI payments
                        and informs you of your monthly spending habits. Me and 3 friends came up with the 
                        idea when we were trying to split the bill in our college restaurant, complaining 
                        about our monthly budgeting. <br>
