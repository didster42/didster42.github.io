                    There exist numerous games which have risen from Half-Life 2 mods, the famous ones include Counter Strike, Black Mesa and Garry's Mod. 
                    Recently, I played The <span class="bold">Stanley Parable</span>, a game released almost a decade back, which was itself created as a Half-Life mod.

                <h3>Whats it about?</h3>
                <p>
                    The game starts with the narrator narrating a story about 'Stanley', an employee working for a huge corporation. 
                    Stanley's life is not a life of adventure or risk taking. 
                    He lives through the same monotonous routine every day. The player is introduced to the life of Stanley, in the words of the narrator -
                </p>
                <p id="specialPara">
                    <i>This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee #427. 
                        Employee #427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a 
                        monitor on his desk telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee #427 did every day 
                        of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, 
                        as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy. And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would 
                        forever change Stanley; Something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he had realized not one single order 
                        had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi'. Never in all his 
                        years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself 
                        unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.</i>

                    <span class="author">Narrator</span>
                </p>
                <h3>Okay, we've got this starting point, what now?</h3>
                <p>
                    The game starts off like that, and it makes you think.<br>
                    <span class="bold">What the hell is going on?</span>
                    <span class="bold">What kind of game is this?</span><br>
                    You begin to answer these thoughts by moving around the office, looking at the desks where people were supposed to be working. You try and fidget with the objects, but nothing makes sense. 
                    You're curious, so you walk along the open doors in front of you, all while the narrator continues with his story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player finally finds himself standing in front of <span class="bold">two open doors</span> and the narrator states,<br>
                    <span class="quote"> "Stanley took the door to his left"</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, you make a choice, do you follow what the narrator is saying?
                    What if this voice in your head is evil?
                    What if following this mysterious voice will end up with you losing the game? What is the point of the game? Whats the story? You want to find out
                    and you dont want to lose. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, the voice could be good, it could just be your conscience guiding you on your path through life. You want that predefined path 
                    through life, it makes life easy. Everything is sorted because everything has been decided for you. You don't know yet if its a good thing or a bad thing,
                     but you follow anyways. Following the path allows the narrator to <span class="bold">finish your story for you</span>. However, you have a choice of not following the 
                     path in front of you. You <span class="bold">have the choice</span> of making your own path in this story. You want to <span class="bold">make your own path</span> and in doing so, you disobey 
                     the narrator. The narrator doesn't like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The narrator desperately tries to get you back on course, back on the accepted path. There even comes a point when after
                     constant defiance of the wishes of the narrator, the narrator finally loses it and transports you to another game,
                     saying, <span class="quote">'You don't like this game? Lets go to another!'</span> I'd never seen this kind of humour in a game before, I find these kind of games
                     hilarious. The narrator transports the player to Minecraft and Portal. 
                </p>
                <h3>Finishing the game.</h3>
                <p>
                    There are a <span class="bold">LOT</span> of combinations and endings to the game, I wasn't able to explore them all. How could I, one path was
                     literally pressing a button for four hours, with the devs testing our patience to the maximum. The experience was really different from the usual games I play. 
                    I absolutely loved playing through it, with its fourth wall breaking to looking at the endings the game had to offer. Seeing that the game came 
                    out in 2013 I'm kinda late to the party, but hey, <span class="bold">better late than never right</span>?
                </p>
                <p id="finale">
                    <span class="bold">Thats all for now!</span>
                </p>
